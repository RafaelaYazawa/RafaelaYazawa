## Hi, I'm Rafaela ðŸ‘‹

# About me 
  I love to go to music festivals and museums (but I don't know anything about it). I love golden retrievers, and hanging out with my friends is one of the things that makes me happy the most. I also enjoy Playstation video games - my favorite is The Last of us part II, and playing sports, especially volleyball. 
  I was a Le Wagon Full-time Web Development student and graduated in March, 2025. I learned so much from it and I am so thankful for the experience.
